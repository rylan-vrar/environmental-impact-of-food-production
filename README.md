As the world‚Äôs population has grown tremendously, so has the global demand for food. Water and energy needs have increased tremendously to meet rising agricultural needs. All of this has had extreme consequences on the environment. Energy sources are being quickly depleted, and carbon emissions from food production are significant. What could be done to feed the world in a more sustainable way? I hypothesize that if we restrict foods that have high energy needs, high volume, and high emissions, we can minimize the environmental impact of food production.
